React is written by Facebook developers

console react likhne se milega

React 
{Children: {…}, Fragment: Symbol(react.fragment), Profiler: Symbol(react.profiler), Component: ƒ, PureComponent: ƒ, …}


1) React.development.js -- core of react
2) React-dom.development.js -- which is useful for DOM ( Document Object Model ) (bridge between react and browser)
why we have 2 different file for react ? 
because does not only work on web ,it also works for mobile development


React is built to manipulate our DOM using JS. updating DOM tree is costliest thing to do 

-props - are children or attribute which we pass
