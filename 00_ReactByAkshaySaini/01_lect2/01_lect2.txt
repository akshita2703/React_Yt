- What is npm?
    npm doesn't have full form
    but it work as node package manager 
    All the package are hosted here


package.json is config file for npm -- it keeps the track of what version we are using -- but if any update will there it will not change 
package-lock.json -- it will keep the exact version of what is installed
-- exact version  lock.json ----- approx version -- package.json

** Every dependencies which are installed in node_module have its own package.json file


-bundler - create the bundle so the code  can be push to production 
    vite is the bundler , web pack 
    parcel 

    there are two types of dependencies we can install 
    1 Dev dependencies - require when we are developing our app
    2 Norma dependencies - can be use in production also

** 
"parcel" : "2.8.3" by using caret(^) ---- just for info  tlide(~) 

"parcel" : "^2.8.3"  -- if any update in minor version it'll automatically update it but not for the case of major version change
tlide(~) --- it will update the major version but that's not the safe to use


What is node modules?
node modules is like the database it contain actul data of these dependencies.
fetches all the code of all the dependencies. it is very heavy

Transitive dependencies ->  parcel need some dependencies to work and these dependencies also need some other dependencies to work 


if i have package.json and package-lock.json , you can re-create your node_module 


npx parcel index.html has hosted our app to Server running at http://localhost:1234

if you want to execute our package you'll use npx (executable file).
build our development and able to host it on localhost

CDN are or prefered way to inject the react in our app

#parcel (Read about parcel )
- Dev build
- Local Server
- HMR = Hot module Replacement 
- file watching algorithm which is written in C++
- it gives you Faster Build because of Chaching . 
- image optimization for you 
- Minification   
- Compressing 
- Bundling
- consistent Hashing 
- code spliting
- Differential Bundling - to support older browser 
- Tree Shaking - remove unused code
